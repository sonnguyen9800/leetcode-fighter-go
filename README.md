# leetcode-fighter-go

Recently, I started solving basic Leetcode question. However, there are so many problem and I don't think doing all of them in consequence would be effective. Fortunately, Neetcode kindly provides a program path for Leetcode for free. The link can be visited here: https://neetcode.io/roadmap

At the same time, I was looking for another language for backend system. The one made me interested is **Golang**, thus I thought this could be one arrow for two targets, practicing Golang while solving & learning on algorithm and analysis. Hell yeah. I couldn't think of anything better.

Here [is](https://sonnguyen9800.com/tip/leetcode-on-go/) the blogs where I documents all the problem and provide detailed analysis on result. Copies of these blogs also contained inside the repository as well.
